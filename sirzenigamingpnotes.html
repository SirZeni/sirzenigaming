<p class="pnotesred">v1.0 (10/22/2022)</p><p class="pnotesblack">First version of sirzenigaming, no changes have been made.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pnotesred">v1.1 (11/19/2022)</p><p class="pnotesblack">Replaced the "Patch Notes" hyperlink with a "Patch Notes" button which will open a separate tab to view the changes.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pnotesred">v1.2 (06/10/2023)</p><p class="pnotesblack">After 7 months of unexpected delays due to hosting errors, sirzenigaming is back up and running. Unfortunatley, one of the YouTube previews has a connection issue. That preview will remain off the site until further notice.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pnotesred">v1.3 (06/14/2023)</p><p class="pnotesblack">Added the SirZeni icon to all pages of sirzenigaming. Changed the medialinks table border on home page to border-collapse.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pnotesred">v1.4 (06/22/2023)</p><p class="pnotesblack">Adjusted the SirZeni icons span for mobile devices, should span across the width of the site without creating a double layer. 
  I also changed the layout of the Patch Notes page, where the descriptions are under the versions and dates. I also implemented layout changes for the home gallery pics and youtube embedded frames. 
  This entire version (1.4) of sirzenigaming is mainly focused on layout for mobile devices.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pnotesred">v1.5 (06/27/2023)</p><p class="pnotesblack">Changed the patch notes button to purple and grey, added a "more pictures" button to the homepage that links to the picture gallery page. 
    Also included a hover color to the media links in the media table, as well as a hover color to the patch notes and more pictures button. 
    Was going to release the picture gallery for v2.0, but decided to release it early because it was finished.</p>
